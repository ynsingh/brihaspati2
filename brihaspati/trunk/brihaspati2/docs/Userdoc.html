Multiple User Registration</u></h3></font>
This module allows an instructor or the administrator to register multiple
users into the system. To effectively use this feature, the authorised
user should write down the email, password, firstname, familyname, 
programcode and rollno all separated by semi-colons. Note that there is no
semicolon after the rollno. Hence, the required format is
<p><b>email;password;firstname;familyname;programcode;rollno</b>
<p>Each field in the entry should consist of alphanumeric characters. Email
field is execption to this. '@' and '_' are allowed for use in this field.
Email and rollno are mandatory fields without
which the new entry into the system will not be registered. Similarly,
an entry containing an illegal character will also not be registered into
the system. Each entry must be in one line and must contain the six fields
separated by five delimiters (;) .
