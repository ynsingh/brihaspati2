<h1>OpenID</h1>

OpenID provides a way to share the same username and password among many websites. OpenID consists of providers (which give you the user accounts that can be reused on other sites) and relying parties (that have websites that accept OpenID accounts). 
<br><br>
Brihaspati is a relying party. Examples of OpenID providers (whose accounts can be used on http://202.141.40.217:8080/openid/) .<br>
<br>
Use of OpenID at Brihaspati server is optional. You do not need to have an OpenID in order to register a user account.
<h1>OpenID delegation pages at http://202.141.40.217:8080/openid/ </h1>

Delegation allows users to use their http://202.141.40.217:8080/openid/username (i.e., http://202.141.40.217:8080/openid/nksinghiitk ) page as a delegation URL for other OpenID sites. A "real" OpenID associated to a http://202.141.40.217:8080/openid/ account is required to enable this feature.

<!--Once logged into SourceForge.net, goto your Account Options page. In the section of links note the link Manage My OpenIDs. 

Select an OpenID to use for delegation, and your http://202.141.40.217:8080/openid/ identity (delegation) for email (username@gmail.com), may now be used at other OpenID-enabled sites.
