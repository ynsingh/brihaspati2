<p><font color="#000000">If a user registers an institute or registers as a student, an instructor or registers a course. Then a confirmation mail is sent at the email address of the user. The confirmation mail consists of a link, which when clicked redirects the user to Brihaspati login page and the registration is completed. At the same time it confirms the authenticity of the user. If due to network congestion, mail is not received by the user, then the user can use this module to request the resending of the mail. When user enters his email address and submits it, then on the basis of his registration the confirmation mail is sent again.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
